## Difference between WHERE and Having - interview point of view notes 
Both are used to filter the records.
This is the similarity in these.
WHERE is used before aggregation and having is used after aggregation.

HAVING CLAUSE is used only when there is an aggregation and group by.

Where clause can be used without aggregation.


Examples:
select * from Emp 
where salary > 10000;

select department_id, avg(salary)
from emp 
group by department_id
having avg(salary) > 10000;

select department_id, avg(salary) from emp 
where salary > 10000 
group by department_id
having avg(salary) > 12000
